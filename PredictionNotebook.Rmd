Let's start by pulling in the breast cancer dataset,
which is already tabular with labels.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("./data/data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
data$X <- NULL
data$diagnosis <- factor(ifelse(data$diagnosis=="B", "Benign","Malignant"))
head(data)
```

This dataset has a lot of variables, some of which are
very likely to be representing the same variance.
We can use the PerformanceAnalytics package to quickly get
a feel for which variables are correlated.

```{r}
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
chart.Correlation(data[,c(3:11)], pch=1, histogram=TRUE, main="Cancer Correlations")
```

Most of these samples must be rather circular, since perimiter and
radius and area are all very closely correlated.
